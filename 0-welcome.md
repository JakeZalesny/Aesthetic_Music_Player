# Welcome Bro. Watson.

Some pointers on running the program:

1. You'll probably need to install raylib with the NuGet Package Manager if it doesn't work for you initially. It should already be included in the .csproj file.

2. 'H' Will only toggle to the song on the DJ playlist it won't toggle back

3. The tasks that the students will need to complete are conveniently located in the Student folder.

4. Any assets should be located in their perspective folders and all file paths are relative so it should work right off the jump.

5. I used: Queues, Sets, Dictionaries, BSTs, and Recursion to make this program.

6. The director isn't the most organized class and I admit that it's not the best modularized but it's working well.

7. Also I think one of the songs might have some language to it, I apologize in advance if that's the case.

8. If you'd like a Demo video I'd be more than happy to make one! Send me a message on teams and I'll get it done.

**I also made a Student-Instructions Markdown file so that if any student used it the instructions would be there for them**
